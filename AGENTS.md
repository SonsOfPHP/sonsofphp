# AGENTS

This repository contains multiple projects and tools that are maintained here.

- Use clear variable names and keep code well documented.
- Run tests relevant to the areas you change.
- For changes under `tools/chorale`, run `composer install` and `./vendor/bin/phpunit` in that directory before committing.
- Chorale is the monorepo management CLI using a plan/apply workflow; see `tools/chorale/AGENTS.md` for its roadmap and guidelines.
